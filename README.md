📈 End-to-End Machine Learning Regression
House Price Prediction (ML Project #2)

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning regression pipeline to predict house prices using structured numerical and categorical features.

The project emphasizes the full ML lifecycle, including exploratory analysis, preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, evaluation, and interpretability. Rather than focusing solely on predictive accuracy, the project highlights model comparison, stability, and business-relevant interpretation.

🎯 Problem Statement

Task type: Regression

Target variable: House price

Domain: Real estate / housing market analysis

Primary challenge: Balancing predictive performance with interpretability and generalization

House prices are influenced by multiple correlated features and often contain outliers, making proper evaluation and validation essential.

📂 Dataset

Housing dataset containing numerical and categorical features related to property characteristics

Common features include:

Property size and layout

Location-related indicators

Structural attributes

Market-related variables

Note: Housing price data often exhibits skewness and extreme values, which can significantly affect regression error metrics.

⚙️ Machine Learning Pipeline
1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explored feature distributions and relationships with house price

Identified skewness, variability, and potential outliers

Examined correlations to inform modeling decisions

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handled categorical variables and numerical features

Applied feature scaling to support coefficient-based interpretation

Performed train/test splitting to evaluate generalization performance

3️⃣ Model Training

Three regression models were implemented and compared:

Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

These models were selected to compare:

Baseline linear performance

Effects of L2 (Ridge) and L1 (Lasso) regularization

Tradeoffs between simplicity, regularization, and interpretability

🔁 Model Evaluation & Cross-Validation
Cross-Validation Strategy

Applied k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) to estimate generalization performance

Evaluated models using multiple regression metrics

Evaluation Metrics

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – Typical prediction error in currency units

MSE (Mean Squared Error) – Penalizes larger errors and highlights outliers

R² (Coefficient of Determination) – Proportion of variance explained by the model

Note: Certain metrics are reported as negative values in scikit-learn cross-validation and are interpreted using their absolute values.

📊 Results & Model Comparison

Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso produced nearly identical performance across cross-validation folds

Similar MAE, MSE, and R² values indicate that:

Regularization did not significantly improve performance at default settings

The feature set was already well-behaved after preprocessing

Small standard deviations across folds suggest stable and consistent performance

✅ Final Model Selection

Linear Regression was selected as the final model because:

It achieved performance comparable to Ridge and Lasso

Coefficients are fully interpretable

It serves as a strong and transparent baseline model

This decision was driven by evidence from cross-validation, not model complexity.

🔍 Model Interpretability

Feature importance was assessed using coefficient magnitudes

Because features were standardized:

Coefficients represent the impact of a one standard deviation change

Larger absolute values indicate stronger influence on price

Positive coefficients indicate price-increasing effects

Negative coefficients indicate price-decreasing effects

This approach supports explainable and business-relevant insights.

⚠️ Limitations

Linear models assume linear relationships between features and price

Outliers in housing prices can inflate error metrics, especially MSE

Non-linear interactions may exist that linear regression cannot capture

🧠 Key Takeaways

Cross-validation provides more reliable performance estimates than a single split

Model simplicity should be preferred when performance is comparable

Interpretability is a major advantage in applied regression problems

Regression metrics must be interpreted in context, not in isolation
